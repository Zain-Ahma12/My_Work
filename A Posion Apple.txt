I was angry with my friend
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe,
I told it not, my wrath did grow,

And I watered it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears;
And I summed it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore a apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stale,
When the night had veld the pole;
In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
